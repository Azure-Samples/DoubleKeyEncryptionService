# Source code repository for the Double Key Encryption (DKE) service for Microsoft 365

Use this repository to download the DKE service. Once you download, install, and set up the DKE service, you keep your keys under your control. This way, your keys are never exposed to Microsoft. Follow the instructions at https://aka.ms/dke to get started.
